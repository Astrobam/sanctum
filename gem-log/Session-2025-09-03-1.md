## Goal
To build the complete MVP version of the Sanctum backend service according to the technical specification.

## Tasks Completed
1.  **Project Structure:** Established a monorepo structure by creating the main `backend` directory to house the FastAPI application.
2.  **Dependencies:** Created and populated `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages and installed them.
3.  **Configuration:** Implemented a secure and robust configuration management system using a `.env` file and a Pydantic `Settings` model.
4.  **Database Models:** Defined all SQLAlchemy models (`User`, `Conversation`, `Message`) with correct relationships, mapping directly to the database schema.
5.  **API Schemas:** Created all necessary Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization for users, tokens, conversations, and messages.
6.  **Security Core:** Implemented essential security utilities for password hashing (`bcrypt`) and JWT creation/verification.
7.  **Authentication Router:** Built the complete authentication flow with `/register` and `/token` endpoints.
8.  **Conversation Router:** Built the protected endpoints for creating and retrieving conversations and messages, linking them to the authenticated user.
9.  **Application Assembly:** Assembled the final FastAPI application in `main.py`, integrating all routers and providing a runnable server.
10. **Best Practices:** Created a `.env.sample` file to ensure secret keys are not committed to version control.
