## Goal
To analyze the user's environment and set up the foundational files for the "Sanctum" project.

## Tasks Completed
1.  Analyzed the provided user environment (macOS, zsh, Python 3.11.8 via pyenv, Node.js v22). Confirmed the environment is modern and well-configured.
2.  Created the `.python-version` file to lock the project's Python version to `3.11.8`.
3.  Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude common Python, Node.js, macOS, and IDE files from version control.
4.  Established the Python virtual environment (`venv`) and provided activation instructions.
