## Goal
To produce a high-quality, comprehensive technical specification for the Sanctum backend and API, incorporating detailed user stories and diagrams.

## Tasks Completed
1.  Established new quality standards for documentation, focusing on a compelling narrative and comprehensive detail.
2.  Refactored the high-level technical overview (`tech_spec_overview.md`) to externalize Mermaid diagrams, resolving a rendering issue.
3.  Clarified the architectural relationship and necessity of `crewAI`, `LangChain`, and `ChromaDB`.
4.  Drafted the complete `docs/tech_spec_part_1_backend.md`, detailing the backend's vision, responsibilities, user stories, database schema, and API endpoints.
5.  Created two new diagrams to support the backend specification: `diagram_database_schema.mmd` and `diagram_message_flow.mmd`.
