## Documents to Review:

To be fully synchronized, you must read the following in detail:

1.  The main project brief located at `gem-log/intro.md`.
2.  **All** technical specification documents (files ending in `.md`) located in the `docs/` directory.
3.  **All** associated diagram files (files ending in `.md`) in the `docs/diagram` directory.

After your review, please confirm you are fully synchronized with all the details.

Our next step is to create the **"Part 2: Frontend"** technical specification document.
